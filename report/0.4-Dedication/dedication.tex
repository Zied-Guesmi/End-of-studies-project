    To my mother,
    A strong and a gentle soul who taught me to trust in Allah, believe in hard work and
    that so much can be done with little. Thank you for loving me unconditionally.

    To my father,    
    For supporting me and encouraging me to believe in myself. You instilled in me the most
    important values to live and you taught me how to embrace life.
    
    To my sister,
    For enlightening my life with joy, love and happiness. I promise to be there for you
    forever.
    
    To all my family, 
    For believing in me and pushing me to improve my knowledge and move my career forward.
    
    To all my friends,
    For all the joy, the support and the happiness you brought to my life.
    
    I dedicate this modest project as a testimony of my affection and my great gratitude.    
    
    Thank you
