    I am using this opportunity to express my gratitude to everyone who supported me throughout the six months 
    of my internship ending up with this report. I am thankful for their aspiring guidance, invaluably
    constructive criticism and friendly advices during the project work.\\
    Firstly, my sincere thanks  goes to Gilles Fedak who provided me the opportunity to join iExec
    and the team as an intern, and who gave me access to all resources and research facilities. Without his
    precious support it would not be possible to conduct this project.\\
    Besides my supervisor Mr Ugo Plouviez, I would like to thank the rest of the team for the share of advices
    and knowledge throughout the internship. They were friendly and helpful in every step of the project.\\
    My sincere thanks also go to Mr Heithem Abbess for his continuous support, for his patience, motivation 
    and immense knowledge. His guidance helped me all the research phase and attainment of this work.
