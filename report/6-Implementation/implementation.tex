\chapter{Implementation}


\section{Introduction}
After fixing the system design and choosing the apropriate hardware, it is time to implement the worker.
The Implementation consists of two parts, assembling the hardware components and preparing the software.
To test the worker we develop some dapps for ARM architecture and integrate them in the iExec plateform.
In the last section we illustrate the work that has been done with some pictures of the worker prototype.

\section{Work environment}

   \begin{itemize}
       \item \underline{Amazon AWS instance as a scheduler and a blockchain node}
       \item \underline{3 Raspberry Pi boards as a cluster of workers}
       \item \underline{A laptop as a client to test the infrastructure}
   \end{itemize}

\section{Software environment}

    \subsection{Blockchain}
    Generate wallets using the SDK

    \subsection{XtremWeb}
    add arm support to the scheduler - cross compiling resin + qemu

    \subsection{Docker}
    % optimization: There are many techniques to reduce the size of the
    % image like multi-stage build and removing the cache whenever it is necessary. After installing all
    % the dependencies in the image, we copy the jar files and the scripts.
    % specs --> heap size

    \subsection{Worker cluster}
    cluster --> swarm - cluster - ansible to verify
