Project's purpos

In this context, this project, originally suggested by iExec, is performed as part of the
preparation to obtain the computer science engineering degree from the Faculty of Mathematical,
Physical and Natural Sciences of Tunis, University of Tunis ELMANAR, Tunisia. This report illustrates
the work that has been done, from design to requirements and implementation. Those topics are covered
in five chapters, we start by contextualizing the project and discussing the state of the art with
a comparison between our perspective and some existing ones. Then, we present the different requirements
and technical specifications which leads us to the implementation details. Finally we conclude and
suggest some improvements to the current limitations.
