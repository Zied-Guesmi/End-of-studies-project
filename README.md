# End of studies project

This repository contains my end of studies project's dissertation and presentation. The project intitled "Positive Energy Worker" was hosted
by iExec Blockchain Tech company in Lyon. It aims to create an iExec worker that used positive energy (solar energy) to execute tasks and simulate,
at the same time, an IoT device.


## Dissertation
Credits: [Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/phd-thesis-template-for-cambridge-university-engineering-department-cued-latex-xelatex-and-lualatex-support-v2-dot-1/kgfqybfnqkdf#.W3vQSNj7RTY)

To edit the Latex report locally, I used the open source VSCode text editor along with [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) plugin.


## Presentation
The pdf gives an overview of the presentation (no animations unfortunately). Ping me if you need access to the real presentation.
